    "1. What do you mean by cells in an excel sheet?\n",
    "Ans: In an Excel sheet, cells are individual rectangular boxes formed by the intersection of rows and columns. They are the basic units where data, text, or formulas can be entered and manipulated. Each cell is identified by a unique combination of a column letter and a row number (e.g., A1, B2), allowing users to organize and analyze information in a structured manner."
