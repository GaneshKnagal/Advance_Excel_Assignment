    "6. Create an appropriate table within the worksheet and use different functions available in the AutoSum command.\n",
    "Ans: functions available in the AutoSum command. Here's an example:\n",

    "Min: Returns the smallest value in the selected cells.\n",
    "Observe Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting a function, Excel will automatically insert the function with the appropriate cell references, and you'll see the result in the selected cell.\n",
    "For example, if your table is in columns A and B, and you apply AutoSum to cell B5, it might generate a formula like =SUM(B2:B4), showing the sum of the values in cells B2 to B4.\n",
