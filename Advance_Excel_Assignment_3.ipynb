    "3. How do you get rid of Formula that omits adjacent cells?\n",
    "Ans: If We have a formula that omits adjacent cells, and you want to adjust it to include those cells, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit the Formula:\n",

    "Click on the cell containing the formula that we want to modify.\n",
    "Adjust the Range:\n",

    "Press Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "After making the adjustment, press Enter to apply the changes.\n",
    "For example, if your original formula is =SUM(A1:A5) and you want to include additional cells, you can edit it to =SUM(A1:A10) to include cells A6 to A10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we're using AutoSum, you can manually drag to select the desired range after clicking the AutoSum button, or type the correct range directly in the formula bar before pressing Enter."
