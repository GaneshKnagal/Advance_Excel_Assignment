    "1. What do you mean by AutoComplete feature in Excel and what are the benefits of using this feature?\n",
    "Ans: AutoComplete is a feature in Excel that predicts and suggests the completion of a cell entry based on the existing entries in the column. When you start typing a value in a cell, Excel's AutoComplete feature attempts to match the entry with values already present in the same column. If a match is found, Excel suggests or auto-fills the remaining characters of the entry.\n",
